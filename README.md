# SIMULATION-OF-ACTIVE-LOWPASS-HIGH-PASS-AND-BANDPASS-FILTERS

## AIM : To Design and simulate the following circuits using LT-Spice
a.	Active low pass filter
b.	Active high pass filter
c.	Active band pass filter

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED: 
LT-Spice

## PROCEDURE:
•	Double click on LT-Spice icon.
•	New schematic window open.
•	Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram .
•	Complete the connection.
•	Save the file by giving file name.
•	Click on the run option ->click advanced open ->select Ac analysis->enter the amplitude time delay stop time value.
•	Click on the run option ->simulation window opens->place the probe ->output graph is obtained.

## RESULT :

Thus the LT-SPICE tool has been studied and active low pass filter,high pass and band pass filter is simulated.
